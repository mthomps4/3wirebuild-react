            <p>To describe myself in one word, I am a builder.</p>

            <p>
                I’m a Developer, Woodworker, a "Do-It-Yourselfer", and
                Adventuring Thinker. Driven by my curiosity, I continue to
                experiment... It’s an itch and the process keeps me motivated.
                Currently, I manage the network and communications for Broadway
                Baptist Church in Louisville, while gaining more experience in
                Web Development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pushing my skills as a developer, I hope to find more ways to
                contribute and build with new technologies. With an interest in
                Bio-Tech, I aspire to bridge the gap further between technology
                and human interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the day it’s nice to “unplug”. When I’m not behind
                a computer, you will normally find me around a workbench. With a
                passion for traditional woodworking I continue to learn and hone
                my craft focusing on hand tools and furniture making. My goal is
                to keep trade skills from becoming another chapter in the
                history book. Learning and sharing what I can, you can follow
                the process on Instagram{' '}
